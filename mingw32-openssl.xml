        <paragraph>openssl is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
          commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit
          implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport
          Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
          general purpose cryptography library.  The project is managed by
          a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to
          communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its
          related documentation.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The mingw32-openssl package provides the documentation
          for the openssl library, a few pre-defined certificates, and
          several useful utilities.  The associated mingw32-libopenssl package
          provides the runtime library and related development files.
